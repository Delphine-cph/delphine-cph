### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Delphine, I'm a Web Developer Fullstack from Paris ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·.

The tools I work with are:
<ul>
  <li>Ruby On Rails</li>
  <li>Stimulus, JavaScript</li>
  <li>CSS and Figma for the design</li>
  <li>Bootstrap</li>
  <li>SQL</li>
</ul>

I want to contribute to the advancement of the health field ðŸ©º.
That's why, my end of bootcamp project @LeWagon was an application for liberal nurses : TooCare.
